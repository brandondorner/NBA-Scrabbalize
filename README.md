# NBA Scrabbalize
## Ranking the NBA based off of teams' and players' name converted to Scrabble scores.

Have you ever had that burning desire to know what Scrabble score a NBA player's name would convert to?

If you answered yes to that question I'd strongly advise that you monitor your NBA and Hasbro affiliated content consumption.

Before you do that, however, be filled with joy knowing that you no longer have to worry and now can have this information at your fingertips.

With this app you can now _impress_ all of your friends with the exact score "**Zion Williamson**" carries on a Scrabble board. (28!)

I paid $1.99 for the api key so I hope you enjoy.
